# PyGraphGen
A simple but powerful python-based SVG graph generator based on your data. It accepts a list of integers like [7, 10, 12] and puts it on a graph. The X axis is assigned automatically (a manual option yould be added later). For example you have the expenses for one year. Now putting them into a list and giving to this program it'd put it on a graph where you can clearely and easily see your situation, by displaying the expense per month. It was useful for one of my discord bots, for counting stuff... Have fun! 
(P.S. You can change the graph depending on your own preferences, like changing colors, line-width, etc...)
